# Analysis

## Univariate Plots

### Dimensions, Column Names and Structure
```{r, echo=FALSE}
dim(bikeShare)
colnames(bikeShare)
str(bikeShare)
```

### Factor Variables
#### Weather
```{r, echo=FALSE}
levels(bikeShare$weather)
```

#### Seasons
```{r, echo=FALSE}
levels(bikeShare$season)
```

### Summary
```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(bikeShare)
```

### Standard Deviations for Numerical Data
```{r, echo=FALSE}
sds <- c("count", "registered", "casual", "windspeed", "humidity", "atemp", "temp")
for (i in 1:length(sds)) {
  print(paste(sds[i], ": ", round(sd(bikeShare[[sds[i]]]), digits=2), sep=""))
}
```

#### Date Ranges

The date range is from
`r strftime(min(bikeShare$datetime), "%b %d, %Y %I%P")` to `r strftime(max(bikeShare$datetime), "%b %d, %Y %I%P")`
and given that 2012 was a leap year we should have 
`r options(scipen=999); 
format(difftime(max(bikeShare$datetime), min(bikeShare$datetime), units="hours"), big.mark=",")`
between the two dates. However, we have only `r format(nrow(bikeShare), big.mark=",")` entries which means that we can count on 
either this being a sample of the timeframe (likely as it's called *train.csv*) or that maybe they excluded hours 
that contained no riders.  We can test for that possiblity...

```{r}
sum(bikeShare$count == 0)
```

So they either don't display hours that have no riders or there are always
riders. Nevertheless, we can count on the fact that we certainly don't have
data for every hour between our selected dates.  In fact we only have
`r options(scipen=999); 
round(nrow(bikeShare) /
      as.numeric(
          difftime(max(bikeShare$datetime), min(bikeShare$datetime),
                   units="hours")),
      digits=4) * 100`%      
of the data.

#### Weather
Since there is a single entry for **Heavy Rain** in the **Weather** column we
will either have to drop that column or combine it with **Rain** if we are to
use it.  

#### Season
```{r, echo=FALSE} 
summary(bikeShare$season)
```
It's interesting how closely matched the seasons are. If this was just entries
that contained riders and not sample data from the timeframe, you wouldn't
expect those numbers to be so closely inline with one another. Then again, even
as a sample they must have sampled from each season to come up with these
results.

# Ridership
As mentioned earlier, all of the entries contain at least one rider and each
entry represents one hour. Median ridership is 145 with a maximum number of
riders of 977.

#### Distributions
At first glance it looks like environmental variables (*temp*, *atemp* ,
*humidity* and *windspeed*) are close to a normal distribution whereas all the
ridership variables (casual, registered and count) are very right skewed. Once
we start plotting we'll see this better.

### Basic Histogram

```{r, echo=FALSE}
qplot(x=bikeShare$count,
      binwidth=35,
      xlab="Number of Riders",
      ylab="frequency",
      main="Ridership Frequency")
```

After transforming the long tailed data to get a better understanding of the
ridership...

```{r, echo=FALSE}
cuberoot_trans = function() trans_new('cuberoot',
                                      transform=function(x) x^(1/3),
                                      inverse=function(x)x^3)

ggplot(aes(x=count), data=bikeShare) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=0.3) +
  scale_x_continuous(trans=cuberoot_trans(),
                     breaks=c(0,50,100,150,200,400,600,800,1000)) + 
  geom_density() +
  ggtitle("Ridership Frequency Transformed (log3)") +
  ylab("Recorded Hours") + 
  xlab("Number of Riders")
```

The transformed ridership appears unimodal with a rise as we move past
50 to the peak at around 175 riders after which we have a steady decline.

There are really three sections to this dataset, Time, Weather and Ridership.
Since we've just reviewed ridership let's take a glance at the other two.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
hist(bikeShare$datetime, breaks=40, xlab="Datetime", freq=TRUE, col="grey")
```

The spread across the dates seems fairly constant over the period of
`r round(max(bikeShare$datetime) - min(bikeShare$datetime))` days. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
h <- hist(bikeShare$temp, 
          breaks=55,
          xlab="Temperature",
          freq=TRUE, col="grey",
          main="Histogram of Temperatures")
xfit <- seq(min(bikeShare$temp), max(bikeShare$temp), length=40)
yfit <- dnorm(xfit, mean=mean(bikeShare$temp), sd=sd(bikeShare$temp))
yfit <- yfit * diff(h$mids[1:2]) * length(bikeShare$temp)
lines(xfit, yfit, col=2, lwd=4)
```

After overlaying the distribution line with the temperature, we concluded that
the temperature and dates don't really tell us much since the expected
distribution appears parametric.

*Which I guess is something - though not exactly interesting.*

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x=weather), data=bikeShare) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=2, aes(fill=weather)) +
  theme(legend.title=element_blank(), legend.position=c(0.7,0.8)) +
  ylab("Frequency") +
  ggtitle("Weather Frequency")
```

It looks like the weather is pretty good in DC.  This will skew our results
with so many clear periods in relation to others when we compare the impact of
weather to ridership.  In other words, if we state that there are more riders
during clear hours we need to account for the fact that there are that many
more clear hours as well.  We'll use averages when dealing with  weather in
this case.

## Bivariate Plots

*note: the ggpairs output took a very long time to run on this over 10k line
       dataset. I included an export of the file labeled as 'ggpairs.png' as
       part of this package.*

Let's see how the ridership stacks up by month.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=bikeShare, aes(x=month, y=count, fill=factor(month))) +
  scale_x_discrete(
    limits=c("Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct","Nov",
             "Dec")) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,1000,100)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  ylab("Ridership") +
  xlab("Month") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") 
```

Though there are more cyclists in the summer months as you might expect, the
increase from January to December is likely a reflection of growth in the
company as a whole over the two year period we are looking at.

Let's break that out over the two year mark to see if that's the case.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

p1 <- ggplot(data=bikeShare[bikeShare$yearmonth < 201200,],
             aes(x=month, y=count, fill=factor(month))) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits=c("Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug",
                            "Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec")) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,1000,100), limits=c(1,1000)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("2011") +
  ylab("Ridership") +
  xlab("Month") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") 

p2 <- ggplot(data=bikeShare[bikeShare$yearmonth > 201200,], 
             aes(x=month, y=count, fill=factor(month))) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits=c("Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug",
                            "Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec")) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,1000,100)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("2012") +
  ylab("Ridership") +
  xlab("Month") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol=1)
```

There was an increase in ridership, let's quantifiy that a bit.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
p1 <- ggplot(aes(x=month, y=count), data=bikeShare) +
  geom_line(data=bikeShare[bikeShare$yearmonth > 201200,],
            stat="summary", fun.y=mean, aes(color="2012"), size=2) +
  geom_line(data=bikeShare[bikeShare$yearmonth < 201200,],
            stat="summary", fun.y=mean, aes(color="2011"), size=2) +
  geom_bar(data=bikeShare.yearmonth_count_mean.wide, aes(y=growth, x=month),
           stat="identity", alpha=0.15) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits=c("Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug",
                            "Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec")) +
  ggtitle("Monthly Growth between 2011-2012") + 
  ylab("Mean Ridership") +
  xlab("Month") +
  theme(legend.title=element_blank(), legend.position=c(0.1,0.8)) +
  annotate("text", x=5, y=20, label="mean change between years")

p2 <- ggplot(aes(x=month, y=mean_growth_rate),
             data=bikeShare.yearmonth_count_mean.wide) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits=c("Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug",
                            "Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec")) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,1,.1), 
                     limits=c(0,1), 
                     labels=c("0%","10%","20%","30%","40%","50%","60%","70%",
                              "80%","90%","100%")) +
  ggtitle("YoY Mean Growth Rates by Month") +
  xlab("Month") +
  ylab("Growth Rate") +
  geom_area(color="red", fill="red", alpha=0.15)

grid.arrange(p2, p1, ncol=1)
```

Total ridership increased by 
`r round((sum(bikeShare[bikeShare$year == 2012,]$count) -
          sum(bikeShare[bikeShare$year == 2011,]$count)) /
          sum(bikeShare[bikeShare$year == 2011,]$count) * 100,
        digits=2)`% from 2011 through 2012, confirming the 
suggestion that growth rates contributed to the difference
in our boxplots.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x=weather, y=count), data=bikeShare) +
  geom_point(stat="summary", fun.y=median, aes(color=weather, size=count)) +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(5,5), guide=FALSE) +
  geom_line(aes(group="summary"), stat="summary", fun.y=median, linetype=2) +
  scale_color_discrete(guide=FALSE) +
  ggtitle("Median Ridership by Weather") +
  ylab("Median Number of Riders") +
  xlab("Weather")
```

Here we normalized the ridership using the median number of riders as
precipitation increases.  As a cyclist, I always suspected that we have
behavorial traits that lean toward the masochistic, but clearly DC riders are a
very strange lot.  Ridership decreases as we would suspect from clear weather
to mist to rain, but then when the weather gets tough the tough get going.  In
a flash of inspriation though I recall that there is only one data point for
*Heavy Rain* so I recreated the graph this way.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

ggplot(aes(x=weather, y=count), 
       data=bikeShare[bikeShare$weather != "Heavy Rain",]) +
  geom_point(stat="summary", fun.y=median, aes(color=weather, size=5)) +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(5,5), guide=FALSE) +
  geom_line(aes(group="summary"), stat="summary", fun.y=median, linetype=1) +
  scale_color_discrete(guide=FALSE) +
  ggtitle("Median Ridership by Weather") +
  ylab("Median Number of Riders") +
  xlab("Weather")

```

These cyclists aren't the animals I first suspected. Given these traits, I
would venture to guess that a lot of riders just got caught in the rain.  Since
the weather seems to be a factor of how much precipitation was inflicted on our
riders, maybe humidity would be a better indicator.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(bikeShare$humidity)
ggplot(aes(y=count, x=humidity), data=bikeShare[bikeShare$humidity > 20,]) +
  geom_point(stat="summary", fun.y=mean) + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,100,5)) +
  ggtitle("Number of Riders as Humidity Increases") +
  xlab("Humidity") +
  ylab("Mean Ridership")
```

The number of riders certainly drops off as humidity increases.

*DC has so few
entries that have humidity levels under 20 
(`r round(100 * (sum(bikeShare$humidity < 20) /
          sum(bikeShare$humidity >= 20)),
          digits=2)`%) and since the data was skewed by these outliers, I felt
it was safe to remove them.*

This is an interesting graph and I'd like to look into it a little more.  I
wonder if this affects casual riders or registered riders more.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

# this graph is a good way to compare the impact between total riders and
# another continuous variable, it then breaks it up into groups of registered
# vs casual riders so we'll house it in a reusable function for the next few
# graphs.

# USAGE:
#   column_name: the name of the column we are studying
#   data: use this to subset the data if needed
compareRiders <- function(column_name="humidity", data=bikeShare) {
  
  display_name <- paste(toupper(substring(column_name, 1, 1)), 
                        substring(column_name, 2),
                        sep="", collaspe=" ")
  
  p1 <- ggplot(aes(y=data[,"count"], x=data[,column_name]),
               data=data,
               environment = environment()) +
    geom_point(stat="summary", fun.y=mean) + 
     
    scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,100,5)) +
    geom_smooth(method="lm") + 
    ggtitle(paste("Total Number of Riders as", display_name, "Increases",
                  sep="")) +
    xlab(display_name) +
    ylab("Mean Ridership")
  
  p2 <- ggplot(aes(y=data[,"count"], x=data[,column_name]),
               data=data,
               environment = environment()) +
    geom_point(color="red", aes(y=registered), stat="summary", fun.y=mean) + 
    geom_smooth(method="lm", aes(y=registered)) +
    geom_point(color="navy", aes(y=casual), stat="summary", fun.y=mean) +
    geom_smooth(method="lm", aes(y=casual)) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,100,5)) +
    ggtitle("Registered (red) vs Casual (blue) Riders") +
    xlab(display_name) +
    ylab("Mean Ridership")
    
  grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol=1)
}

compareRiders(column_name="humidity", data=bikeShare[bikeShare$humidity > 20,])
```

The slope of the casual line looks much flatter than the registered users.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
lm(registered ~ humidity, data=bikeShare)$coefficients
lm(casual ~ humidity, data=bikeShare)$coefficients
```

Does this lead us to believe that humidity levels affect registered users
moreso than casual ones? That seems counterintuitive. I would suspect that
registered riders use the bike system for commuting and would be required to
ride into work no matter what the humidity, whereas casual riders would be
more spontaneous and therefore pursuaded moreso by changes in humidity. The
data is showing us an unexpected relationship.

Since humidity is something you can't really see before you head outside, I'm
left wondering if windspeed would play a greater role.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
compareRiders("windspeed")
```

The plot thickens.  It's plain to see that there's a shift in the data when we
move from one end of the graph to the other.  Since the shift seems to flatten
out when the windspeed reaches around 25-30 mph and a linear model looks like
a good fit on the left, let's plot two different linear models on each section.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
p1 <- ggplot(aes(y=count, x=windspeed), data=bikeShare) +
  geom_point(stat="summary", fun.y=mean) + 
  geom_smooth(data=bikeShare[bikeShare$windspeed <= 30,], method="lm") +
  geom_smooth(data=bikeShare[bikeShare$windspeed >= 25,], method="lm") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,100,5)) +
  ggtitle("Total Number of Riders as Windspeed Increases") +
  xlab("Windspeed") +
  ylab("Mean Ridership")

p2 <- ggplot(aes(y=count, x=windspeed), data=bikeShare) +
  geom_point(color="red", aes(y=registered), stat="summary", fun.y=mean) + 
  geom_smooth(data=bikeShare[bikeShare$windspeed <= 30,], method="lm",
              aes(y=registered)) + 
  geom_smooth(data=bikeShare[bikeShare$windspeed >= 25,], method="lm",
              aes(y=registered)) +
  geom_point(color="navy", aes(y=casual), stat="summary", fun.y=mean) +
  geom_smooth(data=bikeShare[bikeShare$windspeed <= 30,], method="lm",
              aes(y=casual)) +
  geom_smooth(data=bikeShare[bikeShare$windspeed >= 25,], method="lm",
              aes(y=casual)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,100,5)) +
  ggtitle("Registered (red) vs Casual (blue) Riders") +
  xlab("Windspeed") +
  ylab("Mean Ridership")

grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol=1)
```

Riders don't mind the wind and seem to actually graviate toward riding when it
starts blowing. However, at around 25-30 mph, they start to drop off.  It's
much more of a deterrent for registered riders than the casual group.  As the
windspeed increases, the mean becomes more sporatic too, which may be an
indicator that we are seeing fewer entries in that range.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(factor(round(atemp/5)*5), count), data=bikeShare) +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = seq(0,45,5)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = factor(round(atemp/5)*5))) +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title="Temp")) +
  xlab('"Feels Like" Temperature (C)') +
  ylab("Ridership") +
  ggtitle("Ridership by Temperature (C)")
```

As the "Feels Like" temperature increases so do the number of riders...

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Average Ridership per "Feels Like" Temperature
ggplot(aes(x = atemp, y = riders_mean), 
       data=bikeShare.atemp_by_riders) +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks=seq(0,50, 5)) +
  geom_point(size=2) + 
  geom_line(color="blue") + 
  geom_smooth(method="loess",color="red") +
  ggtitle('Average Ridership per "Feels Like" Temperature') +
  xlab('"Feels Like" Temperature (C)') +
  ylab("Mean Number of Riders")
```

It looks like it's starting to level out at around 45C, otherwise as the
temperature goes up we have more riders. There must be a point of diminishing
returns, but we need higher temperatures to find it.

## Multivariate Plots

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x=round(as.integer(hour)/2)*2, y=count), data=bikeShare) +
  facet_wrap(~season) +
  geom_point(aes(color=round(atemp)),
             alpha=0.5,
             position=position_jitter(h=0)) +
  geom_smooth(method="loess",
              color="blue",
              size=2) +
  geom_line(stat='summary',
            fun.y='quantile',
            probs=.5,
            linetype=1,
            color="black",
            size=1.5) +

            size=1.5) +
  geom_line(stat='summary',
            fun.y='quantile',
            probs=.1,
            linetype=2,
            color="red",
            size=1.5) +
  xlab(paste("Hours\nRed dashed lines are 90% and 10% quantitles\n",
             "The smoothing line is blue\nSolid black shows 50% quantitles")) +
  ylab("Riders") +
  labs(color='"Feels Like" temperature (celcius)') +
  theme_few() +
  theme(legend.position="top") +
  ggtitle("Ridership by Hour per Season") +
  scale_colour_gradient2(low="navyblue", mid="blue3", high="olivedrab1")
```

As the weather warms the scatter plot turns green, while it turns blue as it
cools. We can see the growth of the company altering our results slightly as
there are fewer riders in the Spring compared to Winter.  Most notable though
is the bimodal pattern we see in the data. Since this is hourly we are almost
assuredly looking at the impact of commuters. It's interesting that the 
spike in commuter traffic is smaller in the mornings than in the evenings,
which may indicate that though commuters go into work at different times
most leave at around the same time.

After removing the data point for *Heavy Rain*, we split up the results to
review the monthly impact of casual vs. registered riders.

Highlights:

* Riders prefer a clear day and can even stand a little mist, but regardless
of the month or season they are heavily impacted by rain.
* February riders are not influenced by worsening weather as much as March
riders.
* People love to ride in September, but only if it's clear.
* August is a strange month as more people are found riding in the mist than
when it's clear.
* Wether it's clear or misty has very little importance to ridership in
February and December but it's vital to riders in April or May
* Though riders care little about mist in December, if it's raining the mean
plummets.
* Most casual riders don't start riding until March and only then if it's not
raining.

This has me thinking about how the different months can make a person
feel like the weather may be better or worse as you enter it.  I know
from personal experience that 15C can feel warm in January and bitter 
cold in September.  I wonder how riders percieve the actual temperature
based on the season.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
p1 <- ggplot(aes(x=temp, y=count), data=bikeShare) +
  geom_line(aes(color=season), stat="summary", fun.y=mean, size=2) +
  theme(legend.title=element_blank(), legend.position=c(0.1,0.8)) +
  xlab("Temperature") +
  ylab("Mean Riders")
p2 <- ggplot(aes(x=round(temp/2)*2, y=count), data=bikeShare) +
  geom_line(aes(color=season), stat="summary", fun.y=mean, size=2) +
  theme(legend.title=element_blank(), legend.position=c(0.1,0.8)) +
  xlab("Temperature") +
  ylab("Mean Riders") +
  ggtitle("Smoothed")

grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol=1, main="Ridership by Temperature per Season")
```

I expected some of these results, but two things jump out at me.
First, I would expect that Winter would contain the coldest temps
and that Summer would contain the hottest.  However...

```{r, echo=FALSE}
bikeShare %>%
  group_by(season) %>%
  summarise(min = min(temp),
            mean = mean(temp),
            median = median(temp),
            max = max(temp), n = n()) %>%
  arrange(min)

ggplot(aes(x=season, y=temp), data=bikeShare) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill=season)) +
  theme(legend.position="none") +
  xlab("Season") +
  ylab("Temperature") +
  ggtitle("Temperature by Season")
```

Looking closely, Spring has the lowest Temperature
(`r min(bikeShare[bikeShare$season == "Spring",]$temp)`C)
and Fall has the highest
(`r max(bikeShare[bikeShare$season == "Fall",]$temp)`C).  Many times data can
tell you things you don't intuitively understand.  When we think about the
Summer or Winter seasons as being the extremes you might think it's because the
average number of days are warmer in Summer or colder in Winter.  The data from
Washington, DC doesn't support this.  If it was closer to the equator it might
make more sense as temperature extremes grow as you reach the poles but this is
unexplainable...

Maybe the "Feels Like" temperature is different?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
bikeShare %>%
  group_by(season) %>%
  summarise(min = min(atemp),
            mean = mean(atemp),
            median = median(atemp),
            max = max(atemp), n = n()) %>%
  arrange(min)

ggplot(aes(x=season, y=atemp), data=bikeShare) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill=season)) +
  theme(legend.position="none") +
  xlab("Season") +
  ylab("Temperature") +
  ggtitle("\"Feels Like\" Temperature by Season")
```

I concede. Spring and Fall are the most extreme seasons, whereas Summer
and Winter are comparatively mild.

*editors note: This could be due to all the hot air being blown
around by the enormous influx of politicians in the area - more
research is needed.*

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x=count, y=..density.., fill=weather),
       data=bikeShare[bikeShare$weather != "Heavy Rain",]) +
  facet_wrap(~ season) + 
  scale_x_sqrt() +
  xlab("Riders") +
  ylab("Density") +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.2)
```

These density plots confirm what we've seen earlier with regard to the number
of riders during different types of weather.  Cyclists are more likely to ride
in inclement weather during the Spring or Summer than in the Fall or Winter.
Even though, as we determined earlier, Fall is the warmest season and Spring
the coldest.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

probDen <- function(season = "Spring", weather = "Rain") {
  den <- density(bikeShare[bikeShare$season ==
                             season & bikeShare$weather == weather,]$count)
  
  xt <- diff(den$x[den$x < 1])
  yt <- rollmean(den$y[den$x < 1], 2)
  
  print(paste(season, " - ", weather, " density probability: ",
              round(sum(xt * yt) * 100, digits=2), "%", sep=""))
  
  print(paste("Percentage of Entries that had ", weather, " in the ", 
              season, ": ",
              round( 100 * sum(bikeShare$season == season &
                                 bikeShare$weather == weather) /
                       sum(bikeShare$season == season),
                     digits=2),
              "%",
            sep=""))
}

probDen()
probDen("Fall")

probDen("Summer")
probDen("Winter")
```

The above just quantifies this a bit.

# Linear Model for Ridership Counts

I broke the linear models up into casual and registered users as separate
entities and trained for each using the following formulas:

* **casual** hour + year + humidity + temp + atemp + workingday
* **registered** hour + year + humidity + atemp + workingday

Casual returned and R-Squared value of **0.461** and Registered only recieved
**0.31** so we assume it's not going to be a great match.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Simple Linear Regession Model
test <- fetchData(file="test")

# Casual - R-Squared is 0.461 at this point
ma <- lm(casual ~ hour + year + humidity + temp + atemp + workingday,
         data=bikeShare[bikeShare$casual > 0,])

test$casual <- predict(ma, test)
test[test$casual < 0, 'casual'] = 0 # Haters (negative people) aren't allowed

# Registered - R-Squared is 0.31
ma <- lm(registered ~ hour + year + humidity + atemp + workingday,
         data=bikeShare[bikeShare$registered > 0,])

test$registered <- predict(ma, test)

test[test$registered < 0, 'registered'] = 0

test$count <- round(test$casual + test$registered)

# uncomment if you want output files
#submit <- data.frame(datetime = test$datetime, count = test$count)
#write.csv(submit, file = "linear_prediction.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```

Here's the original training data:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(bikeShare$count)
```

and the test data after it's been trained:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(test$count)
```

Both shapes should look similar so we don't have a very good algorithm yet.
We should go back to looking at ways to manipulate the data to make it more
linear or use a different algorithm altogether such as RandomForest for
this data set.

  ylab("Riders")

grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, ncol=1)
```

Looking at the top graph we see a red bimodal line on all days. It's more
extreme as we look at just working days (blue line).  This changes when we look
at the holidays only, as there is a smooth line that simply rises and drops
throughout the day.

*The heavy black line is the mean of all riders across all the data.*

In the second image, we break this out to just working days and further into
casual and  registered riders. Here it's more obvious that registered riders
are in fact, commuting. Commute times peak shortly before 8am and again near
6pm.  There is a slight rise around 1pm which I suspect are those using the
bikes for lunch. In contrast, we don't see any of this behavior in casual
riders.

Though causual riders bike more on holidays, registered users bike less and
the peaks are much less defined. This yeilds more evidence that registed
riders are using these bikes for commuting.

#### Weather

       data=bikeShare) +
  geom_point(aes(color=weather),
             position=position_jitter(h=0),
             alpha=1) +
  geom_line(stat='summary',
            fun.y=mean,
            aes(y=round(registered / 70) * 70,
                color="- Mean Registerd"),
            size=2) + 
  geom_line(stat='summary',
            fun.y=mean,
            aes(y=round(casual / 20) * 20,
                color="- Mean Casual"),
            size=2) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,1000,50)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,45,5)) +
  theme_solarized(light=FALSE) +
  theme(legend.title=element_blank()) +
  ggtitle("Temperature to Ridership by Weather") +
  xlab("Temperature") +
  ylab("Riders")
```


Notice that in the lower right, as the temperature goes up it reaches a point
where there are more and more riders. Eventually there's a point (around
33C) that really takes off and there's never less than 75 riders.
I suspect that this is due to these temperatures only ever occuring during 
the day. It may be interesting that Mist and Rain seems to hover around
certain temperatures, for instance at the extreme outliers we always see
clear weather. However, you might recall that at the start of this 
project we saw that there were significantly more clear days, so I won't
read too much into that.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x=round(humidity/5)*5, y=count),
       data=bikeShare[bikeShare$humidity >= 35,]) +
  facet_wrap(~season) +
  geom_line(stat='summary',
            fun.y=mean,
            aes(group="summary")) +
  geom_point(stat='summary',
             fun.y=mean,
             aes(group="summary")) +
  geom_line(stat='summary',
            fun.y=mean,
            linetype=2,
            aes(y=registered,
                group='summary',
                color='Registered')) +
  geom_line(stat='summary',
            fun.y=mean,
            linetype=2,
            aes(y=casual,
                group='summary',
                colour='Casual')) +

  theme_wsj() +
  theme(legend.title=element_blank())
```


Intuitively we understand that as humidity increases ridership should
drop regardless of the temperature. Though the data supports this
view the really interesting thing is how much riders avoid the
humidity based on season.  In the above, we can see that in the 
Spring people really don't mind the humidity (the mean line is
basically flat) whereas the steep line in the Fall shows how much
these changes in humidity cause people to avoid cycling.

#### Conclusion

* Ridership drops as precipitation rises.
* DC's bikesharing program has grown by over 67% over the two years.
* Spring and Fall are the most extreme Seasons in DC.
* The data was sampled according to the Season, hence the matching number of
hours between the seasons.
* Cyclists are less picky about riding in poor weather during the Spring than
they are during the Fall.

# Reflection

The Bicycle Sharing dataset contains over 10,000 records recorded hourly from
2011-2012. Begining with the total riders (count) and moving on to the
individual columns we were able to develop questions which were answered as we
crawled through the dataset. Eventually we were able to develop a picture of
the dataset and observe how it was built and how it related to ridership.

I was surprised to learn that temperature extremes actually occur in the Spring
and Fall seasons in Washington DC from 2011-2012...

This is contrary to Wikipedia [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season] 

*"Meteorological seasons are reckoned by temperature, with summer being the
hottest quarter of the year and winter the coldest quarter of the year."*

...and my intuition.

#### Other Surprises

* The growth rate was quite significant for ridesharing in DC without
  a single month experiencing a decline and it needed to be taken into account
  for several of our conclusions.
* The single entry for *Heavy Rain* took up more documentation than the
  amount of data it provided.  
* Riders love the wind, until it reaches about 25-30 mph.
* On average, the hotter it gets, the more Riders there are.
* Most people bike in the evenings.
* The month plays heavily into whether cyclists will put up with inclement
weather.

#### Market Perspective

Market focus should be primarily going after the registered riders who use the
service tocommute.

#### Linear Model

After several failed attempts, our linear model finally achieved an R-squared
value of approximately 0.3. We only have 63% of the entire dataset which would
include every hour of the two years. Human nature being what it is, it's
extremely difficult to predict. But if we were able to include this dataset
with other things (such as new marketing strategies, information on what was
used to grow the company between the 2 years--incentive programs, coupons,
extended reach, etc.--along with more detailed information about the placement
of the bikes and the amount of foot traffic or how bike friendly DC is or will
become), we could make better predictions. Given only weather and timeframes,
it isn't exactly a lot to go on, so I found it remarkable that we were able to
explain even 30% of the ridership with what we have. I highly doubt that those
are the only two things that go into the decision to ride, but I'm slowly being
convinced that they are very important factors nonetheless.
